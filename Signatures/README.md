# Schnorr-Signature

Shows how the Schnorr Signature works as a concept. 

The Schnorrgroup and Elliptic Curve are used here.

A test for (multi-) signing and verification is available for both variants.

# EasySignature

EasySignature 2024 is a very fast and very simple signature creator. Multi-signatures can also be created.

Note: Very high standards are set in cryptography for the creation of signatures with verification. 

EasySignature 2024 has neither been tested nor verified by me. 

However, it is freely available to the community.
