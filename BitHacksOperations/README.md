# BitHacksOperations (Full Generic)

I found the first part as a summary on the Internet. I liked it so much that I recorded it straight away. So thank you for the valuable information to: 
https://catonmat.net/low-level-bit-hacks

I solved the second part myself, depending on the problem, and kept collecting and storing it. In the meantime, there are now over 40 small but very effective BitHacks.

I have deliberately put the whole thing together programmatically as a unit test so that the project can be tested. The individual routines run hellishly fast, which is what BItHacks are known for.

I'm sure I'll find a few more interesting BitHacks, which I'll then add here.
