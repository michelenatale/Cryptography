# Cryptographie


## CryptoRandom

CryptoRandom is a very fast, easy-to-use and cryptographically as well as thread-safe random number generator for everyday use.

CryptoRandom is based on the RandomNumberGenerator provided by Dotnet. The most important data types are available for quick use.

CryptoRandom also offers other possibilities, such as shuffling and handling strings.

CryptoRandom can be easily integrated into any project and fulfills its purpose for the lifetime of the application.

## Elliptic-Curve

Shows in a simple way how the sender and receiver function of Alice and Bob works in encrypted form.

The ECDiffieHellman (ec key exchange) and ECDSA (ec digital signing) algorithms are used here.

The elliptic curves are always selected randomly so that everything in the temporary area is used.

## Signatures Schnorr

Shows how the Schnorr Signature works as a concept.

The Schnorrgroup and Elliptic Curve are used here.

A test for (multi-) signing and verification is available for both variants.
