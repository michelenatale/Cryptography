# Elliptic-Curve

Shows in a simple way how the sender and receiver function of Alice and Bob works in encrypted form. 

The ECDiffieHellman (ec key exchange) and ECDSA (ec digital signing) algorithms are used here.

The elliptic curves are always selected randomly so that everything in the temporary area is used.
